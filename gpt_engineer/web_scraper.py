        repo_path (str): The local path of the git repository where changes should be pushed.

    Returns:
        None

    This function uses the gitpython library to interact with the git repository. It first initializes a Repo object with the provided path, then gets a reference to the 'origin' remote. It then pushes the changes to the remote repository.
